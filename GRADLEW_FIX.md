# Gradle Wrapper Fix - Root Cause Found!

## The Real Problem

The GitHub Actions workflow failures were **NOT caused by YAML syntax issues**. The root cause was a **corrupted/outdated `gradlew` script** that was incorrectly parsing command-line arguments.

## Symptoms

Every Gradle command was failing with errors like:
```
Task ''--version'  ' not found in root project 'TodoApp'
Task '':app:testDebugUnitTest' '--stacktrace' '--no-daemon'  ' not found
```

Notice the pattern: `''taskname'  '` - extra quotes at the start and extra spaces at the end.

## Root Cause

The `gradlew` script's `save()` function (around line 180-183) was adding incorrect quoting to arguments, causing:
1. Task names to be wrapped in extra quotes
2. Command-line flags to be treated as separate tasks
3. All arguments to be malformed before reaching Gradle

## The Fix

**Replaced the corrupted `gradlew` script with a fresh copy from the official Gradle repository.**

```bash
# Download fresh gradlew script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/v8.2.1/gradlew -o gradlew

# Make it executable
chmod +x gradlew

# Test it works
./gradlew --version
```

## Verification

After fixing the `gradlew` script:

âœ… `./gradlew --version` works  
âœ… `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` works  
âœ… `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` works  
âœ… All Gradle tasks now execute correctly

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The workflow files (`android-build.yml`, `android-ci.yml`, `pr-checks.yml`) are now correctly configured with:
- Proper module paths (`:app:taskName`)
- No quotes around commands (YAML handles them correctly)

Example:
```yaml
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: ./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest
```

## Important Notes

1. **The gradlew script must be committed to Git** - it's part of the Gradle Wrapper and should be version controlled
2. **Always use the Gradle Wrapper** (`./gradlew`) instead of a system-installed Gradle to ensure consistency
3. **The wrapper JAR file** (`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`) should also be committed

## Files Changed

1. âœ… `gradlew` - Replaced with fresh copy from Gradle v8.2.1
2. âœ… `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` - Updated task paths
3. âœ… `.github/workflows/android-ci.yml` - Updated task paths  
4. âœ… `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` - Updated task paths

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the fixed gradlew script**:
   ```bash
   git add gradlew
   git commit -m "fix: Replace corrupted gradlew script with fresh copy"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions should now work correctly!** ðŸŽ‰

## Why Android Studio Worked

Android Studio uses its own Gradle distribution and doesn't rely on the project's `gradlew` script, which is why tests worked in the IDE but failed in CI/CD.
