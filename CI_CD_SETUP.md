# CI/CD Setup Guide for Todo App

## 🎯 Overview

This project now includes automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions that:
- ✅ Run unit tests on every PR
- ✅ Build Android APKs
- ✅ Generate code coverage reports
- ✅ Run lint checks
- ✅ Post results as PR comments
- ✅ Block merging if tests fail

---

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

```
.github/workflows/
├── android-ci.yml      # Main CI pipeline
├── pr-checks.yml       # Enhanced PR validation
└── README.md           # Workflow documentation
```

### 2. Configuration Files

- **`app/build.gradle`** - Updated with JaCoCo plugin for code coverage
- **`TEST_REPORT.md`** - Comprehensive test report
- **`CI_CD_SETUP.md`** - This file

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflows and test configuration"

# Add remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **"Actions"** tab
3. You should see the workflows automatically enabled
4. If prompted, click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

### Step 3: Test the CI Pipeline

Create a test PR:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b test-ci

# Make a small change (e.g., update README)
echo "# Testing CI" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test CI pipeline"
git push origin test-ci
```

Then:
1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
2. Watch the CI checks run automatically
3. See test results, coverage, and build status

## 🔧 Workflow Details

### Workflow 1: `android-ci.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop`
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**What it does:**
1. **Test Job**
   - Runs all unit tests
   - Uploads test results
   - Comments results on PR

2. **Build Job**
   - Builds debug APK
   - Builds release APK (unsigned)
   - Uploads APKs as artifacts

3. **Lint Job**
   - Runs Android lint checks
   - Uploads lint report

4. **Status Check**
   - Verifies all jobs passed
   - Provides summary

**Time:** ~5-8 minutes

---

### Workflow 2: `pr-checks.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Pull request opened/updated

**What it does:**
1. Validates Gradle wrapper
2. Runs unit tests with coverage
3. Generates JaCoCo coverage report
4. Posts coverage comment on PR
5. Builds debug APK
6. Runs lint checks
7. Posts comprehensive summary

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Overall: 40% minimum
- Changed files: 60% minimum

**Time:** ~6-10 minutes

---

## 📊 Understanding CI Results

### Green Checkmark ✅
All checks passed! Your PR is ready to merge.

### Red X ❌
Something failed. Click on "Details" to see:
- Which tests failed
- Build errors
- Lint issues
- Coverage problems

### Yellow Circle 🟡
Checks are still running. Wait for completion.

---

## 🎨 PR Comments

After CI runs, you'll see comments like:

```
🤖 CI Build Summary

✅ Build Status
- Unit Tests: ✅ Passed (7/7)
- Lint Checks: ✅ Passed
- APK Build: ✅ Success

📊 Test Coverage
- Overall Coverage: 65.3%
- Changed Files: 72.1%

📦 Artifacts
- Debug APK available in workflow artifacts
- Test reports available in workflow artifacts

📝 Next Steps
✅ Coverage looks good!
```

---

## 📦 Downloading Artifacts

### From GitHub Actions:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on a workflow run
3. Scroll to **Artifacts** section
4. Download:
   - `app-debug` - Debug APK
   - `app-release` - Release APK (unsigned)
   - `test-results` - HTML test reports
   - `lint-results` - Lint report

### APK Installation:

```bash
# Download app-debug.apk
# Install on device/emulator
adb install app-debug.apk
```

---

## 🔒 Branch Protection (Recommended)

Protect your main branch:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Select checks: `test`, `build`, `lint`
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging (optional)
5. Click **Create**

Now PRs can't be merged if CI fails!

---

## 🧪 Local Testing

Before pushing, test locally:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests with coverage
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest jacocoTestReport

# View coverage report
open app/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run lint
./gradlew lintDebug

# Run all checks at once
./gradlew test assembleDebug lintDebug jacocoTestReport
```

---

## 📈 Code Coverage

### View Coverage Locally:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest jacocoTestReport
open app/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoTestReport/html/index.html
```

### Coverage Report Shows:
- Overall coverage percentage
- Coverage by package
- Coverage by class
- Line-by-line coverage
- Missed branches

### Improving Coverage:

1. **Identify gaps:**
   - Check coverage report
   - Find uncovered lines (red)

2. **Add tests:**
   - Focus on business logic
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error handling

3. **Run coverage again:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean testDebugUnitTest jacocoTestReport
   ```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow not running

**Solution:**
- Check if Actions are enabled
- Verify workflow file syntax
- Check branch names match triggers

### Issue: Tests failing in CI but passing locally

**Solution:**
- Check Java version (should be 17)
- Verify dependencies are synced
- Check for environment-specific code

### Issue: Coverage too low

**Solution:**
- Add more unit tests
- Focus on Repository and ViewModel tests
- Remove `@Ignore` from tests if possible

### Issue: Build failing

**Solution:**
- Check Gradle version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are available
- Check for syntax errors

### Issue: Lint warnings blocking merge

**Solution:**
- Fix lint issues: `./gradlew lintDebug`
- Or suppress if justified:
  ```kotlin
  @Suppress("LintWarning")
  ```

4. ✅ Address reviewer comments
5. ✅ Keep PR focused and small

### After Merge:

1. ✅ Delete feature branch
2. ✅ Pull latest main
3. ✅ Verify deployment (if applicable)

## 📊 CI Metrics to Track

Monitor these over time:

- **Test Pass Rate:** Should be 100%
- **Build Success Rate:** Should be > 95%
- **Average CI Time:** Keep under 10 minutes
- **Code Coverage:** Aim for > 70%
- **Lint Issues:** Keep trending down

---

## 🔄 Updating Workflows

### To modify workflows:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/*.yml`
2. Test changes in a feature branch
3. Create PR to see if changes work
4. Merge when satisfied

### Common Modifications:

**Change coverage threshold:**
```yaml
min-coverage-overall: 50  # Increase from 40
```

**Add more branches:**
```yaml
branches: [ main, develop, staging ]
```

**Change Java version:**
```yaml
java-version: '17'  # or '11', '21'
```
