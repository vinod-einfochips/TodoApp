# 🚀 GitHub Actions CI/CD - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows (2 files)

#### `android-ci.yml` - Main CI Pipeline
- Runs on push to main/develop
- Runs on pull requests
- **Jobs:**
  - Test (runs unit tests)
  - Build (creates APKs)
  - Lint (checks code quality)
  - Status Check (verifies all passed)

#### `pr-checks.yml` - Enhanced PR Validation
- Runs on pull requests only
- **Features:**
  - Unit tests with coverage
  - JaCoCo coverage report
  - Coverage comments on PR
  - APK build
  - Lint checks
  - Comprehensive PR summary

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### `app/build.gradle`
- Added JaCoCo plugin
- Configured code coverage
- Added `jacocoTestReport` task

### 3. Documentation (3 files)

- `.github/workflows/README.md` - Workflow documentation
- `CI_CD_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🎯 What It Does

### On Every Pull Request:

1. **Automatically runs:**
   - All unit tests (7 tests)
   - Code coverage analysis
   - Android lint checks
   - Debug APK build

2. **Posts comment with:**
   - Test results (pass/fail)
   - Coverage percentage
   - Build status
   - Download links for artifacts

3. **Blocks merge if:**
   - Tests fail
   - Coverage below 40%
   - Build fails
   - Lint has errors

### On Push to Main/Develop:

1. **Runs full CI pipeline**
2. **Generates artifacts:**
   - Debug APK
   - Release APK (unsigned)
   - Test reports
   - Lint reports
